## Project Overview

Hianime-MCP is a microservice that provides anime information through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface. The project serves as a bridge between anime data sources and AI assistants, enabling natural language interactions about anime content.

The service scrapes data from anime websites (primarily hianimez.to) and exposes it through a standardized MCP API, which can be consumed by AI-powered applications, chatbots, and other services that implement the MCP client standard.

Key capabilities include:
- Homepage information retrieval (spotlight and trending anime)
- Detailed anime information lookup
- Genre listings
- Character and voice actor information
- Promotional video data
- Related and recommended anime discovery

## Architecture Analysis

### System Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Client Layer"
        MCP["MCP Clients"] --> API
        Custom["Custom Clients"] --> API
    end

    subgraph "API Layer"
        API["MCP Server API"] --> Scrapers
    end

    subgraph "Business Logic Layer"
        Scrapers["Scrapers"] --> Models
        Utils["Utility Functions"]
    end

    subgraph "Data Layer"
        Models["Data Models"]
    end

    subgraph "External Services"
        AnimeWebsites["Anime Websites"]
    end

    Scrapers --> AnimeWebsites
```

```

### Data Flow

The flow of data through the system follows this pattern:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as MCP Client
    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant Scraper as Anime Scraper
    participant Website as Anime Website
    
    Client->>Server: Request anime data
    Server->>Scraper: Invoke scraper
    Scraper->>Website: HTTP request
    Website-->>Scraper: HTML response
    Scraper->>Scraper: Parse HTML
    Scraper-->>Server: Structured anime data
    Server-->>Client: JSON response
```

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

The project is built using:

1. **Python 3.12** - Core programming language
2. **FastMCP** - Implementation of the Model Context Protocol server
3. **BeautifulSoup4** - HTML parsing and scraping
4. **Cloudscraper** - Handling Cloudflare protection
